# Wild Kratts Memory Game
A fun memory game for kids built with React.

## Motivation
I created this game in order to gain experience with React.

## How it Works
The objective of the game is to click on each image once, until all 12 have been clicked. To add a little extra challenge, the images move each time one is clicked.

## Process
The frontend was built using react components. The images from the Kid's TV Show Wild Kratts are outlined in the JSON file in an array of objects and are passed through the cards of the frontend.

## Technology Used
* React
* Bootstrap
